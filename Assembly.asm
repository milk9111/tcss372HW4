; Daniel and Connor 
; 372 Problem 4

; Part 1
; The assembly program will prompt a user to enter their first name. It will allow the user to type in their name. The string
; should be stored in a memory location (BLKW #20). 

; Part 2a
; The program should then call a subroutine that "encrypts" the name by 
; subtracting a small constant from each character and replacing the original string with the new one. The subroutine will
; need the starting address of the string location passed to it in R1. (Get location of subroutine from R1)

; Part 3a (Function of Subroutine)
; It will loop through the string subtracting the constant from each character and replacing it in the array.

; Part 3b
; The subroutine return the starting address of the array in R0, (to indicate success) the program will print prompt
; "Press any key to continue: ".  

; Part 4
; When user presses key (without echo) the program prints the array (using trap x22).
